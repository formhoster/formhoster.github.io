    <h1>We handle form submissions so you can focus on design</h1>

    <p>When we went to launch our new <a href="https://www.literatecomputing.com/">Jekyll Site for Literate Computing</a> we didn't like any 
        of the form processing sites we found, so we decided to make our own, just to get the job done. Then we decided that
        the system was too good not to share.</p>

    <h2>Built on top of Discourse</h2>

    Literate Computing provides installation, management, and support services for <a href="https://discourse.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Discourse</a>, 
    the best forum software on the planet. When we needed a form processing platform, we created a Discourse plugin. <a href="https://hub.formhoster.com/">https://hub.formhoster.com/</a> 
    is where you can go to discuss forms as well as have them processed. If you have recommendations about how to make things better, we have a public place where 
    you can let us know.

    <h2>Add a form to your static web side</h2>

    You have your web site. Now you want to get some information from your site visitors. .

<h1>We provide the code you need to make forms work</h1>

We know how to make forms work. Our customizable template system generates the HTML needed to insert the form on your site
while you craft the message you will receive when the form is submitted. 

  <h2>Automatically generated HTML with Jekyll Frontmatter</h2>

Our expertise is in automating things so that they work and no one has to worry about them. You want HTML that
will result in your form getting processed? We've got you. It's your responsibility to make it pretty (but we will do our best to make
that as easy as possible).
